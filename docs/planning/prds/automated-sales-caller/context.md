# Sales Caller Project Context

## Project Overview

The Automated Sales Caller is a critical component of Mile High Marketing's sales automation ecosystem. It bridges the gap between prospect research (handled by the pipeline component) and human sales engagement.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
The sales team spends 60% of their time on initial cold calling, with only a 5% success rate in reaching decision makers. This manual process limits scaling and wastes valuable selling time on unqualified prospects.

### Solution
An AI-powered calling system that:
- Automates initial prospect outreach
- Qualifies leads through natural conversation
- Books meetings for interested prospects
- Provides detailed conversation summaries

### Expected Impact
- **Time Savings**: 30+ hours/week of manual calling
- **Scale**: 50+ automated calls per day vs 10-15 manual
- **Qualification**: 15% qualification rate vs 5% manual
- **ROI**: 668% projected based on cost analysis

## Technical Context
