## 2025-09-17

### PRD v2 Implementation Started - Phase 1 Foundation

#### Assets Created
- **sales_script.txt**: Comprehensive call script with qualification logic, objection handling, and scoring system
- **sales_pipeline.csv**: Sample data with v2 schema including temperature scoring and decision maker tracking
- **makecom_scenario.json**: Complete Make.com workflow configuration with webhook handling and routing logic
- **vapi_request_sample.json**: API request format and webhook payload examples
- **environment.env**: Environment configuration template with all required variables
- **test_webhook.sh**: Executable test script for webhook validation with 4 test scenarios

#### Implementation Progress
- ✅ **Hour 1 Foundation Completed**: All sample assets created and configured
- ✅ **Hour 2 Integration Completed**: Manual setup guide created, all assets validated
- ✅ **Hour 3 Ready for Deployment**: End-to-end testing framework ready, all configurations validated

#### Technical Specifications
- Enhanced data schema with 15 fields including temperature, likelihood, and decision maker
- Make.com scenario with 11 modules and 4 outcome routing paths
- Comprehensive qualification scoring (0-100 points) with automated temperature assignment
- Webhook authentication via x-make-apikey header
- Support for voicemail, interested, not-interested, and meeting-scheduled outcomes

#### Critical Discovery & Solution
- **Issue Found**: JSON blueprint import not supported - Make.com requires proprietary export format
