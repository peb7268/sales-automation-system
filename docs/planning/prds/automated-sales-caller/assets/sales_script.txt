Hi {{lead_name}}, this is Sarah from Mile High Marketing calling for {{company}}.

I've been researching {{industry}} businesses in your area and noticed {{company}} has been doing great work. I specialize in helping {{industry}} companies like yours increase their online visibility and attract more qualified customers.

{{#if dm}}I was hoping to speak with {{dm}} about{{else}}I was hoping to speak with the decision maker about{{/if}} how we've helped similar {{industry}} businesses increase their revenue by 30-50% through targeted digital marketing strategies.

Do you have just 2 minutes for me to share what we're doing for other {{company_type}} businesses in your market?

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]

**If YES - Continue with qualification:**
Perfect! Let me ask you a few quick questions:

1. What's your biggest challenge right now when it comes to attracting new customers?
2. Are you currently doing any digital marketing - website, social media, or online advertising?
3. How are you primarily getting new customers right now?

Based on what you're telling me, I think we could definitely help {{company}}. We've worked with {{industry}} businesses and typically see results within 60-90 days.

Would it make sense to schedule a brief 15-minute call where I can show you exactly what we've done for similar businesses and see if there's a fit?

**If INTERESTED:**
Excellent! I have some time available {{next_business_day}} afternoon or {{day_after_next}} morning. What works better for you?

[Schedule meeting and capture contact info]

**If NOT INTERESTED:**
I completely understand. If things change and you'd like to explore ways to grow {{company}}'s customer base, feel free to give me a call back. 

Have a great day!

**If OBJECTION - "Not interested":**
I totally get that - you probably get a lot of calls like this. Let me ask you this: if I could show you a way to bring in 5-10 more qualified customers per month for {{company}}, would that be worth a 15-minute conversation?

**If OBJECTION - "Too busy":**
I completely understand how busy you must be running {{company}}. That's exactly why this might be perfect for you - our system runs on autopilot once it's set up. 

How about this - what if I send you a quick 2-minute video showing the results we got for {{similar_business_example}} so you can see if it's worth a brief conversation?

**If OBJECTION - "Already doing marketing":**
That's great that you're already investing in marketing! Can I ask what's working best for you right now? 

[Listen to response]

What we specialize in is making sure businesses like {{company}} aren't leaving money on the table. Even if you're getting some results, we often find ways to double or triple what's already working.
