# TaskMaster Removal Plan for Sales Automation Pipeline

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This plan outlines the complete removal of TaskMaster from the sales automation pipeline's operational orchestration while preserving it solely for development workflow management. The pipeline will transition to a **fully autonomous JSON-based orchestration system** with Claude Code agents and local processing.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### TaskMaster Usage Assessment
Based on comprehensive codebase analysis:
- ✅ **Pipeline is TaskMaster-free**: No TaskMaster dependencies found in operational code
- ✅ **JSON system exists**: Complete JSON-based task management already implemented
- ✅ **Local processing**: All agents run locally with Obsidian integration
- ✅ **Agent orchestration**: AgentOrchestrator handles all coordination

### Current Architecture
```
Sales Pipeline Operation:
JSON Task Definitions → TaskManager → AgentOrchestrator → AI Agents → JSON Output → Obsidian

Development Workflow (separate):
MHM Development → TaskMaster → Development Tasks → Linear/Billing
```

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Autonomous Agent System Enhancement
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Objective**: Replace any remaining manual orchestration with intelligent agent coordination

#### 1.1 Claude Code Agent Integration
- **Agent Type**: Claude Code MCP-enabled agent for intelligent decision making
- **Role**: Primary orchestration intelligence and dynamic task adjustment
- **Capabilities**:
  - Analyze pipeline performance and adjust task schedules
  - Handle complex decision trees for prospect qualification
  - Manage agent coordination based on real-time data
  - Process natural language instructions for pipeline modifications

#### 1.2 WebSocket Communication Layer
```typescript
// Real-time agent communication
interface AgentCommunication {
  protocol: 'websocket';
  events: ['task_completed', 'prospect_updated', 'pipeline_stage_change'];
  immediate_response: boolean;
}
```

#### 1.3 RabbitMQ Durable Storage
```typescript
// Long-term task orchestration and queuing
interface TaskQueue {
  storage: 'rabbitmq';
  queues: ['prospecting', 'outreach', 'analytics', 'maintenance'];
  durability: 'persistent';
  retry_logic: 'exponential_backoff';
}
```

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Modernization
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Objective**: Implement robust local-first infrastructure with cloud deployment capability

#### 2.1 Docker-Compose Infrastructure
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3-management
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: sales_pipeline
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: ${RABBITMQ_PASSWORD}
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672"
    volumes:
      - rabbitmq_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq

  websocket_server:
    build: ./infrastructure/websocket
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://rabbitmq:5672
    depends_on:
      - rabbitmq

  agent_orchestrator:
    build: .
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://websocket_server:8080
      - RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://rabbitmq:5672
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}:/app/obsidian
    depends_on:
      - rabbitmq
      - websocket_server
```

#### 2.2 Local Development Setup
```bash
# Local development commands
npm run infra:start    # Start RabbitMQ + WebSocket locally
npm run agents:dev     # Development with hot reload
npm run pipeline:test  # Test entire pipeline locally
```

#### 2.3 MacBook M3 Optimization
- ARM64 Docker images for optimal performance
- Local SQLite for fast agent state management
- Memory-efficient agent scheduling
- Native Node.js clustering for parallel processing

### Phase 3: Enhanced Agent Coordination
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Objective**: Implement intelligent agent coordination with adaptive scheduling

#### 3.1 Claude Code Integration as Primary Agent
```typescript
interface ClaudeCodeAgent {
  role: 'primary_orchestrator';
  capabilities: [
    'dynamic_task_scheduling',
    'performance_analysis',
    'pipeline_optimization',
    'natural_language_configuration',
    'error_recovery_strategies'
  ];
  mcp_tools: [
    'task_management',
    'obsidian_integration', 
    'analytics_processing',
    'prospect_qualification'
  ];
}
```

#### 3.2 Agent Communication Protocol
```typescript
// Real-time coordination via WebSockets
interface AgentMessage {
  type: 'task_request' | 'task_completion' | 'status_update' | 'error_report';
  agent_id: string;
  task_id: string;
  data: any;
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  requires_response: boolean;
}
```

#### 3.3 Adaptive Task Scheduling
- **Machine Learning**: Learn optimal scheduling from historical performance
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute tasks based on agent availability and performance
- **Priority Queue**: Urgent tasks (hot leads) get immediate attention
- **Backoff Strategy**: Intelligent retry logic for failed tasks

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Observability
**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Objective**: Comprehensive monitoring without external dependencies

#### 4.1 Real-Time Dashboard (Obsidian-based)
```markdown
# Sales Pipeline Status Dashboard
## 🟢 System Health: Operational
- Active Agents: 5/5
- Queue Depth: 12 tasks
- Last Update: 2025-01-31 14:23:45

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- Prospects Generated Today: 15
- Pipeline Conversion Rate: 8.3%
- Average Response Time: 2.4 minutes
```

#### 4.2 Logging and Alerting
```typescript
interface MonitoringSystem {
  logs: 'winston' | 'pino';
  metrics: 'prometheus_compatible';
  alerts: 'obsidian_notes' | 'email' | 'slack';
  health_checks: 'http_endpoints';
}
```

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Component Interaction Flow
```
1. JSON Task Definitions → TaskManager loads configurations
2. TaskManager → RabbitMQ queues tasks by priority/schedule  
3. RabbitMQ → WebSocket Server broadcasts task availability
4. Claude Code Agent → Receives tasks, makes intelligent decisions
5. Specialized Agents → Execute tasks (prospecting, pitches, etc.)
6. Agent Results → WebSocket real-time updates
7. JSON Processor → Converts results to Obsidian format
8. Obsidian Integration → Updates dashboards and prospect files
```

- Operates independently with Claude Code intelligence
- Processes everything locally with cloud deployment capability  
- Maintains all data in JSON/Obsidian format
- Provides real-time monitoring and adaptive optimization
- Scales efficiently on modern ARM64 hardware

The transition leverages existing JSON-based infrastructure while adding sophisticated agent coordination and real-time communication capabilities.
